<p>published 1978</p>
<p>Â£1.99, oxfam</p>
<p>verdict: mostly good supernatural thriller but also very cursed</p>
<p><img src="https://nathanrw.dev/posts/20230411-the-spear/./images/the_spear.jpg" alt="the spear front cover" /></p>
<p>the good</p>
<ul>
<li>car chase where a mini is pursued by a chieftain tank possessed by the ghost
of Heinrich Himmler</li>
<li>final boss is zombie (you guessed it) Heinrich Himmler complete with little
spectacles (they do fall off) aided and abetted by MI5 and elements of the US
military</li>
<li>zombie's head explodes when shot, both removing the head <em>and</em> destroying the
brain as per the proper procedure</li>
</ul>
<p>the bad</p>
<ul>
<li>sustained and very nasty weapons-grade transphobia rears its head toward the
end of the book (there's more to be said on violence and misogyny in this book
but this particularly stuck out!)</li>
<li>the villain has a prosthetic nose so you know he's evil</li>
</ul>
<p>the weird</p>
<ul>
<li>each chapter begins with an epigraph by Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler,
Richard Wagner or similar, weaving in the story of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsifal">Parsifal</a> and the Nazis appreciation
of it.</li>
<li>elements of the deep state in thrall to a nazi cult are behind the IRA, the
Baader-Meinhof group, the Japanese Red Army, industrial militancy in the
united kingdom (which is in the same category), as well as Palestinian
resistance in a bid to discredit the left and take over the world, in a sort
of proto-QAnon conspiracy</li>
</ul>
<p>misc</p>
<ul>
<li>protagonist is of the same alcoholic loner template used in the other two
James Herbert books I have read, this time a former arms dealer who used to
work for Mossad, who epitomise a sort of action-hero ethic of righteous
violence meted out against a dehumanised enemy. at the start of the book he
is disillusioned with the cycle of violence and revenge and has quit to work
as a PI. but by the end we're perpetrating hate crimes and machine-gunning
nazis so theres a bit of having-your-cake-and-eating-it going on. it's a very
violent book and perhaps a bit fascist itself.</li>
</ul>
