# Genocide

Palestine
South Africa
Algeria

BDS / PSC
  - why not some other struggle?
     - e.g.
       - Xinjiang
       - Sudan
       - Congo
       - ...
     - BDS campaign is call for solidatory for palestinians themselves
     - Any campaign is by definition not another campaign. if youre doing one
       thing you are not doing anything thing
       - Why don't you start that campaign?
          - Because those who raise this question have no real concern
            about these other places
     - Our government is supplying and supporting the genocide. nobody thinks
       what is going on in these other places is good!!!

Britain's role
  - Is it meaningless for us to condemn genocide because we are powerless?
  - no -- we are supplying and assisting it!!! 

Is opposititon to israel antisemoitic?
  - no!
