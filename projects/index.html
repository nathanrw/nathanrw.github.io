<p>The following is a selection of <em>spare time</em> projects of mine. Most of my professional
work is on closed-source proprietary software; these repositories are <em>not wholly</em>
representative of professional-quality code, although <em>parts</em> of them are probably
up to scratch.</p>

<p>A space game written in Python. It's currently a very simple arcade space shooter.</p>
<h3 id="features">features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simple, custom 'entity component system' object model whereby entities are imbued
with data and behaviours by adding 'components' to them.</li>
<li>Abstract rendering architecture with software and 'modern' (for the time!) OpenGL renderers.
<ul>
<li>Graphical effects such as bloom.</li>
<li>Batching and ordering of draw calls.</li>
<li>Aimed at low-end netbook hardware, which is what I wrote it on.</li>
<li>Snapshot of a work in progress, as detailed in extensive comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>'nuklear' IMGUI integration.</li>
<li>'pymunk' physics engine integration. Physics bodies synced with data model.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nathanrw/single-header-c-libs-in-python">github</a> <a href="https://www.nathanrw.dev/single-header-c-libs-in-python/#/">slides</a></p>
<p>This is a presentation I did on a technique I used for consuming single header C libraries from Python in a personal project, utilising the hard work of other people so that I did not have to do any!</p>
<p>Given a single-header dependency with no existing binding, you can easily create (and build, and package) one by feeding the header directly to <code>cffi</code>, with some simple text transformations to remove problematic syntax.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nathanrw/nuklear-cffi">github</a></p>
<p>A semi-automatic Python binding for the nuklear C library.</p>
<p>The core of this is a python program that parses the nuklear.h header for declarations and passes this to the 'cffi' Python binding generator.</p>
<p>Declarations are extracted using a C preprocessor followed by some simple ad hoc text transformations. The 'pcpp' preprocessor is used. This is a C preprocessor written in Python, so the preprocessing step doesn't actually require a C compiler to be installed.</p>
<p>However, the process of generating the Python binding requires a C compiler.</p>
<p>Some code for interfacing nuklear with pygame is provided under pynk.nkpygame.</p>
